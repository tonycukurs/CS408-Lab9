# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

This project has a webpage where you play as a ball that collides with other balls. You try to delete all of the present balls on screen.

The bulk of this project was done in main.js and some of it was done in index.html. There is a counter that shows the remaining balls left on the screen.
